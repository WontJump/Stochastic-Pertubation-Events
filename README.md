# What I want 

**Graph current state** 
- historic states 
- pertubation event history 
- *I believe this will be handled by DyNetX* 

**Graph dynamics engine** 
- triadic closure 
- stochastic randomness 
- homophily 
- kiromoto model 
- fear of the other side powered by lack of interaction 

**Stochastic Pertubation Event (SPE) Driver** 
- choosing which SPE to activate 

**Initial graph state** 

**Graph visualisation** 

**Measurable topological properties** 
- clustering 
- polarisation when considering homophily models 

# TODO 
- make the active graphs update in teh change_driver function 
- check that the graphSPEModel works 
- make simplest possible test functions for graph dynamics engine and SPE drivers 
- try and initialise the polarisation example
