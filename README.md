# What I want 

**Graph current state** 
- historic states 
- pertubation event history 
- *I believe this will be handled by DyNetX* 

**Graph dynamics engine** 
- triadic closure 
- stochastic randomness 
- homophily 
- kiromoto model 
- fear of the other side powered by lack of interaction 

**Stochastic Pertubation Event (SPE) Driver** 
- choosing which SPE to activate 

**Initial graph state** 

**Graph visualisation**
